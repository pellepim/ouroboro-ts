# ouroboro-ts
A python library for specifying time rules and getting sensible timestamps in return.

I.e this library answers the question: when is the next time this happens?

Say for example you want to find out at what specific UTC time the rule "every thursday of every third week of every second month at 8 o'clock UTC" would happen.
